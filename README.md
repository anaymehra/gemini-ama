# Gemini Wrapper APP - ASK ME ANYTHING

## Overview
This project provides a web-based interface that utilizes the Gemini API to offer an interactive ask-me-anything (AMA) experience. Users can input prompts or questions, and the application processes these queries through the Gemini API, delivering generated responses. Essentially, it serves as a wrapper around the Gemini API, streamlining its integration and presenting a user-friendly platform.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying or running this application, ensure you have the following:

- A Gemini API key
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
- Basic understanding of JavaScript, React (or your preferred frontend framework), and API integration

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-wrapper-api.git
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
cd gemini-wrapper-api
npm install
```
### Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the project root and add your Gemini API key:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Project Structure:
The project is typically structured as follows:

1. src: Contains the source code for the application
    -components: Reusable UI components
    -api: Handles API interactions with Gemini
    -App.js (or main component): The main application component
2. public: Static assets like index.html, favicon, etc.
3. package.json: Project dependencies and scripts

### Usage
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Access the application:
1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port).
2. Input your query or prompt in the provided input field.
3. Click the submit button to send the query to the Gemini API.
4. The generated response will be displayed on the screen.

### API Integration:
The application interacts with the Gemini API using a dedicated API service or helper function. This component handles request formatting, authentication with the API key, and response parsing.

### Customization:
The application can be customized in various ways:
1. UI/UX: Modify the appearance and user experience to match your preferences.
2. Functionality: Add features like query history, user profiles, or advanced query options.
3. Integration: Integrate with other services or platforms for enhanced capabilities.
